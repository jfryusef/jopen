## Welcome to jopen

---

#### What is jopen?

The name "jopen" is made up of the words "jo" (my nickname) and "open" (referring to its [open-source](https://github.com/jfryusef/jopen) nature). jopen is a blog about mostly tech-related projects I do for fun. In fact, jopen itself is one of them!

#### Who is behind this?
![avatar.jpg](/images/yusef-portrait.jpg)
I'm yusef. I was born in 2002, and Iâ€™m currently a fifth-grade teacher in Tehran (GMT +03:30). Right now I'm trying to self-study computer science in my free time.
[This is my GitHub](https://github.com/jfryusef) and [this is my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jfryusef4th). You can find me pretty much everywhere on the internet under the username jfryusef and email me [at] gmail [dot] com.

#### Why did I start it?

I wanted to take notes on the process of my projects, and there was no reason to keep them private. So, I made jopen, _to learn in public_.

#### How did I make it?

[Here](https://jfryusef.link/posts/how-i-made-jopen/) is a whole post about how this blog works. But basically, it works using Markdown and [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

#### How can I support it?

You can support me (and therefore jopen) with crypto; [Here is the URL](https://www.jfryusef.link/support/) to a web page with the addresses - no pressure, just there if you want it.
