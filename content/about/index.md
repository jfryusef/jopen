## Welcome to jopen

---

#### What is jopen?

The name "jopen" is made up of the words "jo" (my nickname) and "open" (referring to its [open-source](https://github.com/jfryusef/jopen) nature). jopen is a blog about mostly tech-related projects I do for fun. In fact, jopen itself is one of them!

#### Who is behind this?
![avatar.jpg](/images/yusef-portrait.jpg)
My name is yusef. I was born in 2002, and I'm currently an elementary teacher and web designer based in Tehran. I like computers and am passionate about open source concepts (beyond just software)â€”a geek/nerd, if you will.  
[This is my portfolio/CV](https://jfryusef.work) and you can find me pretty much everywhere on the internet under the username _jfryusef_ and email me [at] gmail [dot] com.

#### Why did I start it?

I wanted to take notes on the process of my projects, and there was no reason to keep them private. So, I made jopen, _to learn in public_.

#### How did I make it?

[Here](https://jfryusef.link/posts/how-did-i-make-jopen/) is a whole post about how this blog works. But basically, I built it using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

#### How can I support it?

You can support me (and therefore jopen) with crypto; [Here is the URL](https://www.jfryusef.link/support/) to a web page with the addresses - no pressure, just there if you want it.
